  ==  Escher/Droste effect software  ==

Created by Bas Fagginger Auer, 2012.
Directly inspired by http://blog.wolfram.com/2009/04/24/droste-effect-with-mathematica/.

Released under the GNU General Public License version 3 as published by the Free Software Foundation (see COPYING).

  ==  Installation  ==

To build this software, it is necessary to have access to the following tools:

 - A C++ compiler,
 - CMake (http://www.cmake.org/),

as well as the following development libraries:

 - Simple Directmedia Layer (http://www.libsdl.org/).

Compile instructions (from the current directory):

 - mkdir build
 - cd build
 - cmake ..
 - make

If the compilation was successful, you should now have access to clustering executables in the directory build/src/.
To use, issue
  - build/src/escher foo.bmp
and click anywhere in the source image to start the Escher effect for that particular colour (usually it is best to paint an area of the image with a specific colour).
The output is saved as 'escher.bmp' in the current directory.
